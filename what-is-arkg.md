# Archaeology Knowledge Graph (ArKG) Chile

> ArKG is an interdisciplinary initiative between Archaeology, Physics, and Computer Science that seeks to organize, systematize, visualize, and openly distribute archaeological dates from Chile.

ArKG is established by recognizing the fundamental importance of dating and dating methods in archaeology, both in Chile and worldwide. This information, beyond its archaeological application field, has its origin as a method in the physical sciences, and the study of the data allows us to understand both the past of humanity at large scales, in archaeology, as well as the recent past of physics. Furthermore, the way in which data is worked with and acquired is strongly determined by digital methods of computation, both at the instrumental level and in terms of data organization and distribution. Therefore, there is a need to conduct inter- and transdisciplinary research dedicated to the multimodal and multi-focus understanding of dating.

ArKG seeks to establish the best way to organize archaeological dating data and systematize it within a structure designed for the future. For this reason, the dating data is formatted as a **Knowledge Graph** in [RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework), following current trends to maintain unstructured data on the semantic web. The Knowledge Graph data is openly available to the community, and the latest version can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/ArKG-Data/ArKG-docs/tree/main/data). Users can query the knowledge graph through SPARQL [here](https://arkg.cl/queries) or navigate it [here](https://arkg.cl/graph). ArKG is powered by storing the knowledge graph in [MilleniumDB](https://github.com/MillenniumDB/MillenniumDB), a graph-oriented database management system, developed by the [Millennium Institute for Foundational Research on Data (IMFD)](https://imfd.cl/), which follows the latest standards, techniques, and trends for managing graph data. 

Our literature analysis reveals the need to improve dating reportability standards, making definitions transparent and enabling long-scale traceability.
We consider archaeological dates as digital heritage (Ministerio de las Culturas, las Artes y el Patrimonio, 2024; UNESCO, 2009), for which we are responsible for its durability, care, maintenance, and distribution. Therefore, ArKG is proposed as a platform that, while preserving the data, provides open access. However, this accessibility is implemented from an idea of broad consultation, strongly influenced by the FAIR principles (Wilkinson et al., 2016), which propose that data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable by the entire community.

This is a fully open source project: code and data.
