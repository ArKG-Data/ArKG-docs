# Archaeological Knowledge Graph (ArKG) Chile

## Interdisciplinary project between Archaeology, Physics, and Computer Science that seeks to organize, systematize, visualize, and openly distribute archaeological dates from Chile

ArKG is established by recognizing the fundamental importance of dating and dating methods in archaeology, both in Chile and worldwide. This information, beyond its archaeological application field, has its origin as a method in the physical sciences, and the study of the data allows us to understand both the past of humanity at large scales, in archaeology, as well as the recent past of physics. Furthermore, the way in which data is worked with and acquired is strongly determined by digital methods of computation, both at the instrumental level and in terms of data organization and distribution. Therefore, there is a need to conduct inter- and transdisciplinary research dedicated to the multimodal and multi-focus understanding of dating.

ArKG seeks to establish the best way to organize dating data and systematize it within a structure designed for the future. For this reason, the use of Knowledge Graphs has been chosen instead of traditional table databases (relational or not), specifically MillenniumDB (Vrgoč et al., 2023). Our interest is to prepare the data for the future, especially considering the integration of LLM structures for querying.

Our literature analysis reveals the need to improve dating reportability standards, making definitions transparent and enabling long-scale traceability.

We consider archaeological dates as digital heritage (Ministerio de las Culturas, las Artes y el Patrimonio, 2024; UNESCO, 2009), for which we are responsible for its durability, care, maintenance, and distribution. Therefore, ArKG is proposed as a platform that, while preserving the data, provides open access. However, this accessibility is implemented from an idea of broad consultation, strongly influenced by the FAIR principles (Wilkinson et al., 2016), which propose that data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable by the entire community.

This is a fully open source project: code and data.
